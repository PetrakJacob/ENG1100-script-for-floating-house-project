# Foating House Project

An ESP32 based project that mapped differnet IR remote inputs to specifc motor activation and deactivation

**Tech Used** C++, Arduino framework, ESP32

**Key Features**
- Ir transmission and receiving
- 2 DRV8833 Motor driver modules to control all 4 motors
- electrical DC motors to power drive system and wiring
- Buck converter to step down voltages to the required level efficiently, unlike using a simple resistor which wastes power
